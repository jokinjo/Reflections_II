A pull request is the assertion that my local version is ready to be merged into a remote branch.

The administrator looks at phe request, which includes ??.. a summary of changes and ..?? so thqt the administrator can 
determine whether the changes on my branch perform as purported and will merge into the remote branch without 
any conflicts with changes to the remote since I first downloaded the remote branch.

It is to be hoped that at least there are no conflicts with current remote branch, so I will get the up-to-date remote
to merge my branch.
