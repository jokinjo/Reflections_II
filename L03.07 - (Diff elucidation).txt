The staging "area OR index" lists the files that are changed from those in the last commit (and are set to be commited) 
To see the diff between the working directory and staging area use git diff --staged OR git diff --cached.

git diff shows changes in the staged files and the last commit.

If there are no staged changes then git diff shows changes to working directory files on top of the last commit,
 and git diff --staged shows nothing.
 
If there are no changes in the working directory, git diff shows nothing, 
 and git diff -staged shows diff from staged files and last commit.  
If Staged = Last Commit, git diff --staged shows nothing
 and git diff shows the changes in WD since Last Commit.
 
 
Below YYY First changes are staged and no further changes
  AND XXX First Changes are staged and Second Changes are in WD (not staged)
