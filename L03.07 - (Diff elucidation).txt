The staging "area" lists the files that are changed from those in the working directory
To see the diff between the working directory and staging area use git diff --staged OR git diff --cached.

git diff shows changes in the staged files and the last commit.

If there are no staged changes then git diff shows changes to working directory files on top of the last commit,
 and git diff --staged shows nothing.
 
If there are no changes in the working directory, git diff shows nothing, 
  and git diff -staged shows diff from staged files and last commit.
