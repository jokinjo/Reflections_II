I was making additional changes to a staged <file>, and accidently inserted some random characters at 
random places (worst case scenario) .

I could revert to the staged version by: (1) committing the staged <file> and (2) git checkout HEAD,
BUT if I do not want to lose the changes made before the "accident"
 by: git checkout --patch <file> which presents the changes in "diff chunks." (According to SO.) 
 OR git checkout --<file>  Which will leave the <file> state as of the last commit. (According to Git.)

In order to selectively discard changes to the working <file> use: git checkout --patch <file> <-- WORKS!
 Note: All of the reversions will take the <file> back to the last commit, i.e. before the staged version!
  In this case, i.e. accepting ALL of the reversions presented by git checkout --patch <file>, 
   How to de-add (i.e. overwrite the WD version with the staged version)
   in order get the staged changes into the WD version???
