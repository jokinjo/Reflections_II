I was making additional changes to a staged <file>, and accidently inserted some random characters at 
random places (worst case scenario) .

I could revert to the staged version by: (1) committing the staged <file> and (2) git checkout HEAD,
but if I do not want to lose the changes made before the "accident" by: git checkout --patch <file>  
(According to0 SO.) OR git checkout --<file>  Which will leave the <file> staged. (According to Git.)

In order to selectively discard changes to the working <file> use: git checkout --patch <file> <-- WORKS!
